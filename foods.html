    <h1>Filipino's Food Taste </h1>
    <p>The majority of Filipino cuisine has a distinct flavor that combines sweet, <br/> 
    sour, and salty elements. The food of the Philippines evolved for taste and need, <br/>
    like many other cuisines. In the warm tropical climate, using souring ingredients <br/>
    when cooking aids in food preservation.</p><br/>

    <p>The cuisine that we eat in the Philippines today is a direct combination<br/> 
    of locally sourced products, flavors, and foreign influences. Each region of the<br/> 
    Philippines exhibits these influences in regional adaptations of well-known <br/>
    dishes due to its diverse terrain and extensive indigenous history.  </p><br/>
